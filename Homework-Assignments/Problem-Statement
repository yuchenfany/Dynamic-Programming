Shindler gives lots of homework assignments, each of which have an easy version and a hard
version. Each student is allowed, for each homework, to submit either their answer to the
easy version (and get e_i > 0 points) or the hard version (and get h_i > 0 points, which is
also guaranteed to always be more than e_i) or to submit neither (and get 0 points for the
assignment). Note that e_i might have different values for each i, as might h_i. The values for
all n assignments are known at the start of the semester.

The catch is that the hard version is, perhaps not surprisingly, more difficult than the easy
version. In order for you to do the hard version, you must have not done the previous assignment at all: neither the easy nor the hard version (and thus are more relaxed, de-stressed,
etc). Your goal is to maximize the number of points you get from homework assignments over
the course of the semester. Give an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to determine
the largest number of points possible for a given semesterâ€™s homework choices.
