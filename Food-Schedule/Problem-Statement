Problem Statement: 
College students get a lot of free food at various events. Suppose you have a schedule of the
next n days marked with those days when you get a free dinner, and those days on which you
must acquire dinner on your own. On any given day you can buy dinner at the cafeteria for
$6. Alternatively, you can purchase one week’s groceries for $20, which will provide dinner
for each day that week. However, because you don’t have a fridge, the groceries will go bad
after seven days (including the day of purchase) and any leftovers must be discarded. Due to
your very busy schedule, these are your only three options for dinner each night.
Write a dynamic programming algorithm to determine, given the schedule of free meals, the
minimum amount of money you must spend to make sure you have dinner each night and
to print the dates on which you should purchase groceries. Explain why your algorithm is
correct and has running time polynomial in n, the number of days on the schedule.
